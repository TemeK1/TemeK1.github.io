  "text2": "If you have ideas, suggestions, feedback or whatsoever, feel free to contact me via email.",
  "text3": "If you like Scribble 2000 and for some weird reason would like to buy me mug of hot 'n steamy coffee as a sign of support, please feel free to use following link.",
  "text4": "Your notes are only stored into a local Realm-database of the application, and furthermore, your notes are encrypted with AES-256. So in case your phone gets stolen, and someone tries to pry on the data inside it (without real access to your phone), at least your notes will be safe. What more can you hope for? Well, maybe for AES-512 protection.",
