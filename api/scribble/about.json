  "text3": "If you like Scribble 2000 and for some weird reason would like you buy me mug of hot 'n steamy coffee as a sign of support, please feel free to use following link.",
  "text4": "Your notes are only stored into a local Realm-database of the application, and furthermore, they are even encrypted (Google Realm-database if you are interested). Forgive me for inconvenience, but email/link are not pressable on purpose, so you have to copy them by hand. Personally I wouldn't want to have weird clickable links in simple apps. Maybe it is just me. Anyhow!",
