		<h2>Who?</h2>
		<p>Natural scientist, animal researcher, vole researcher, large mammal researcher, project researcher and animal ecologist. Many options - one man. Personally I prefer to be called 'bootleg biologist' (saapasjalkabiologi in Finnish).</p>
		<p>I am from Oulainen, Northern Ostrobothnia. I was born in 1991. Between 1998 and 2010 I completed statutory school and high school in my city of birth. In autumn 2010 I went to study animal ecology into University of Oulu. I finished bachelor degree in 2014, specializing into environmental protection and habitat selection and social information use of birds.
		In 2016 I finished master degree, specializing into animal ecology and morphological variation of moose's jawbone in geographical landscape. After the studies I have been working as a project researcher in University of Jyväskylä researching predator - prey interactions of bank vole and least weasel. I have also studied effect of noise and light pollution on the great tit (<i>Parus major</i>) in Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW).
		<h2>What Now?</h2>
		<p>On December 2019 while writing this, I am doing Master level studies in Software Technology in University of Jyväskylä. I started on January 2019. According to my current study plan I aim to graduate in late spring of 2021.
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>First and foremost I should probably say that I read books. But all of us do, right? So it doesn't count as a hobby? Just like walking or breathing. I also like animals a lot. Currently I have one dwarf-hamster as a pet. Many other animals are to my liking as well! I do like hiking (especially in Lapland) but I am still bit of a rookie in that. Among my other hobbies are comics, photographing, urban exploring and gaming.</p>
