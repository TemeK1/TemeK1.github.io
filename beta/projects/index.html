		<p>This website itself is made by me and one purpose of it is to show my skill and determination for future employers as well. JavaScript is not my strongest suit yet so CV graphics itself were created with React-library by using sample code found from online. So the found code is adapted to my purposes and rest is written by me.</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://github.com/TemeK1/Projects" target="_blank">repository</a> for my study related projects. List of projects worth mentioning for is not very long yet. There are several smaller tasks I have done over the years mostly in personal level as a hobby but they are not ready or concrete enough to be uploaded to public repository.</p>
		<p>Also I have created some Drupal based websites over the years. One for Biology Department in University of Oulu where I was studying previously, one for my student guild of that time and few pages for private people.</p>
