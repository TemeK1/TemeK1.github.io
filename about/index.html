		<h2>Who I was before?</h2>
		<p>Natural scientist, animal researcher, vole researcher, large mammal researcher, project researcher, and animal ecologist. Many options - one man. Personally I prefer to be called 'bootleg biologist' (saapasjalkabiologi in Finnish).</p>
		<p>I am from Oulainen, Northern Ostrobothnia. I completed statutory school and high school in my city of birth. I went to study animal ecology into the University of Oulu. During bachelor's degree I specialized in environmental protection and habitat selection and social information use of birds.
		In 2016 I finished a master’s degree, specializing in animal ecology and morphological variation of moose's jawbone in the geographical landscape. After the studies, I have been working as a project researcher at the University of Jyväskylä researching predator-prey interactions of bank vole and least weasel. I have also studied the effect of noise and light pollution on the great tit (Parus major) in the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW).</p>
		<h2>What Now?</h2>
		<p>In July 2020 while writing this, I am wrapping up master-level studies in Software Engineering at the University of Jyväskylä. I started in January 2019. According to my current study plan, I aim to graduate in the late spring of 2021. This summer I will finish the last normal courses and apart from those I will have a one special programming task and a master thesis that I should still attend to. Meanwhile studying, I am keeping eyes and ears wide open for job opportunities at the moment.</p>
		<h2>My Dream Job</h2>
		<p>This one is not so clear to me yet. There are so many interesting career paths in IT. Being part of a software developing team is one of my aims. I want to contribute by working hard and seeing the results of my own work. Doesn't matter if results are to be seen in the form of well-written program code, fresh ideas, or bugs found through software testing or all of these combined. The results are results. As long as I can contribute to increasing the overall quality of the software under development. Furthermore, I definitely would not mind having some kind of cybersecurity/system vulnerability aspect on my job either. After all, maintaining high standards in data and system security is essential for one to meet the requirements of any software developing project.</p>
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
    First and foremost I should probably say that I read books. But all of us do, right? So it doesn't count as a hobby? Just like walking or breathing. I also like animals a lot. Currently, I have one dwarf-hamster as a pet. Many other animals are to my liking as well! I do like hiking (especially in Lapland) but I am still a bit of a rookie in that. Among my other hobbies are comics, photographing, urban exploring, and gaming.
